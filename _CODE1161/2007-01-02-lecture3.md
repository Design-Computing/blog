This week you'll be working in your own _environment_. This is the beginning of a process of refinement that will last for your whole career.

We'll talk about _abstraction_ and problem _decomposition_. How to break up problems into small enough chunks to solve, and how to make those solutions as general as possible.

You'll use _tests_ to make sure that your code what you think it does.

# This week's reading :books:

**Cormen, T. & Balkcom, D.**, [_Algorithms._](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms)

Go through the Intro to algorithms, Binary search and Asymptotic notation sections, these guys have made it really simple to understand and it'll reinforce everything we've said in the lecture.

# This week's homework
