# This week's reading
**Shaw, Z. A.** (2013). [_Appendix A: Command Line Crash Course._](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html) Do as much of this tutorial as you can. It'll cement what you've learned already.

**Victor, B.** (2011). [_Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction._](http://worrydream.com/#!2/LadderOfAbstraction)

# This week's homework

There are some files in the week 2 folder in GitHub. Work your way through the exercises until all the tests pass. Each time a new test passes, make a commit. Then when all tests pass, or when you give up, push to _your_ repo. This will be the first time you've done this, so leave plenty of time before the 7pm cut off on Thursday. This is a hard deadline, so don't miss it.

Do these tutorials to really ram this stuff into your brain.

* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)

It'll go over the same stuff we've already done, but it'll be phrased in a slightly different way, that should deepen your understanding. The better you understand this really foundational stuff, the easier everything else will be.
