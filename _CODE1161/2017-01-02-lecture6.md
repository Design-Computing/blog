# Theory

### What do we mean when we say _data_?

### Displaying data

Plot
Hist - hist ideas, shape(range, spread, skew), bins
bar (categorical)

Important things for all charts:
title, axis titles (with units)

# Technology

## Jupyter Notebooks

## Pandas :panda_face:

The core library for almost all of the data analysis work in python is `pandas`.

It provides a few really powerful data structures, and a whole load of tools for doing operations on those data.


### Tutorials

The tutorials below are probably the most commonly referenced pandas tutorials. The Pandas Cookbook and Learn Pandas are both already structured into Jupyter Notebooks, so you can play along at home if you download the notebook from their repos.

There also are a gazillion [pandas tutorials on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pandas+python) so try a few out and see who you like best.

#### [Pandas Cookbook](https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook)
 > The goal of this cookbook is to give you some concrete examples for getting started with pandas.

What more could you want out of life!? This is really nice as a complement to the docs. If there is something that looks a bit hard to understand (and the pandas docs can often be pretty overwhelming!) then this might well have a worked example of how to do that thing.

#### [Learn Pandas](https://bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas)

This is pretty thorough! Once you've finished this and the cookbook you can pretty much consider yourself a data pro!

#### [Pandas & Seaborn - A guide to handle & visualize data elegantly](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2017/03/16/pandas-seaborn-a-guide-to-handle-visualize-data-elegantly/)

This is a nice intro to pandas, and a [gentle intro to `seaborn`](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2017/03/16/pandas-seaborn-a-guide-to-handle-visualize-data-elegantly/#seaborn), which is a simplified version of `matplotlib`. It uses the Titanic dataset, which is about who was on board the Titanic when it sank. It's got things like each passenger's ticket class and if they survived or not.

#### (So Youâ€™d Like To Make a Map Using Python)[http://sensitivecities.com/so-youd-like-to-make-a-map-using-python-EN.html]

I have to admit, I haven't gone through this tutorial, but it looks good. A fairly simple introduction to how to do maps with pandas and choropleth maps. (This one is for people who are feeling brave!)

# This week's reading :books: / :headphones:

:headphones: **Polich, K.** (2016). [_Let's Kill the Word Cloud. _](http://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2016/kill-the-word-cloud)

:books: **Tufte, E.** (2001) [_The Visual Display of Quantitative Information_](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi). Read chapter 4: _Data-Ink and Graphical Redesign_. If you feel so inclined, read the whole book!

:books: **Wong, D.** (2010) _[The Wall Street Journal Guide to Information Graphics<small>: The Dos and Don'ts of Presenting Data, Facts, and Figures</small>](http://www.donawong.com/)_.


# This week's homework

There isn't any _homework_ from now on, but we'll continue to suggest things that you should do. These things are usually vital steps in your data project, that you can bring with you to tutorials to talk through with people.
