Before I say anything, I'd like you to fill in these three questionnaires.

It's split into three so that I can't reverse engineer the data and find out information about you personally. We'll talk about why I'm doing that in more detail in the lecture on data ethics.

This one takes up a bit more space, so if you want to complete it in it's own tab, [then here's the link](https://goo.gl/forms/i9Z1RfP0QcRimwRX2).

OK, once you're done close your laptop, and let's get started. (This just lets me know how many of you are done.)

If you are _incredibly_ impatient they these are the slides for this lecture:

## Additional reading :books:

These are important pieces, but not directly related to the course. It'd be good for your development as a human to read these:

* [Our model---Be nice.](http://stackoverflow.com/help/be-nice)
* [Are Your Enemies Innately Evil?](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i0/are_your_enemies_innately_evil/)

# In the Lab :microscope:

Get settled in somewhere you can see the big screen, get connected to the internet, and we'll begin.

## Some more admin

A lot of this course is automatically marked. This means that we can spend more time talking to you and solving interesting problems. This _does_ mean that you need to be very precise with some things.

First off, make sure you have a real, grown up, adult email address. `magical.sparkles93@bigpond.com` isn't going to look very cool on your CV when you are 40. You exist as a continuous thing. You'll have various work and uni emails over your life, but it's important to have a continuous email address. That way you can register yourself as yourself, then associate yourself with your work. When you sign up for [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), [Medium](http://medium.com/) and [Github](https://github.com), use this email address. Speaking of that, sign up for all of them now!

You can also [redirect your UNSW email to that address](https://www.it.unsw.edu.au/alumni/email/redirect_external.html) if you like, but make sure you read up on the implications of that.

### Getting registered.

We need some details from you so that we can actually know that you exist!

:fork_and_knife: Fork the [base repo](https://github.com/notionparallax/code1161base) and rename your fork to not have _base_ in the title.

You can write your name however you want, that's just a check, but your student number and clone path must be exactly correct. Your student number starts with a **z**, and you can find your clone path here:

![a screen shot of the GitHub interface]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/17/clonePath.png)

Now fill in these details:
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/a/notionparallax.co.uk/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdy5mpFA9yBrwXJcP_QrvIA9naJTKtktDaFp0WjlZG0XzgJdw/viewform?embedded=true"></iframe>

<figure class="half-width right aside">
##### What's happening around the back here

This form will make a spreadsheet of your git clone path, your name and your student number. The bit of information I _actually_ want is your clone path, but I need to associate it with _you_. We use your student number as a unique key between the list of enrolled students and the information you've given us. The name is what we call a _sanity check_---it makes sure that we're looking at the right information.

Once we have all the git clone URLs we can give that to a script that will clone the repo for each student onto my computer. That tells my computer where to go to get your work. Then when I want to see your work on Thursdays at 7pm, I can run another script that does a `git pull` in each repo. That way, you can keep working (give it 10 or 15 minutes for safety) if you really want to, knowing that I've got the work at the 7pm state.

Then I'll run _another script_ that runs that weeks tests against each repo and outputs all the marks.

See how important it is that you get this right!? If for some reason you don't get it right, we can fix it, but it will kill fairies to do so.

### Back on topic

Because you've cloned my version of the base repo, it's got all of _my_ details in it. You need to change this to have your details. Click the pencil :pencil2: and edit `aboutMe.yml` so that it's got your details.

What you are looking at here is in the [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format. It's got _keys_ on the left and _values_ on the right. They are separated by a colon `:` so make sure that you don't use any colons in your values. If you need a colon for some reason then you can put the whole value into quotes. E.g. `name: "Vlad: the impaler"` and that'll behave properly.

![a screen shot of the aboutMe.yml file]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/17/fillIn.png)

That information should be enough for us to make a table of all the information we need to mark your work and to help you achieve greatness this semester!

...and with that:

# _Finally_ some programming!

# This week's homework

1. Read the readings, it's good for you!
2. Read the assignment descriptions and the course outline, it might feel dorky, but it's good to know what you're getting into! Put all the dates onto your calendar - be prepared.
3. Buy a notebook. I like Clairefontaine paper[^nb], but you can buy anything. I don't really like Moleskine, the paper is junk.
4. Write your first lab look post, you might want to write about your first forays into programming, or maybe how this week's lecture and lab is different to any programming you've learned before. You could write about things that you encounter in life that can be thought of in a new way after what you've learned today. Maybe even put in a photo of your new notebook! Remember to submit it to the publication.
5. Do this course: [try.github.io](https://try.github.io) to get your Git skills up to speed.
6. Make sure that your VM is working.

    This is going to take a few steps.

[^nb]: I use a [Clairefontaine basic clothbound notebook](http://www.officeworks.com.au/shop/officeworks/p/clairefontaine-essentials-a5-lined-notebook-tobacco-cf79546) It's robust so it lasts well, and the paper is a joy to write on. In the past I've also used school exercise books, they are basically the same, so don't stress about it! Just don't get anything that you feel too precious about writing in. I had an expensive notebook once and I never used it because I was 'saving it', idiot!
