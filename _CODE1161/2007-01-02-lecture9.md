# This week's reading :books:

# This week's homework

There are some files in the week 2 folder in GitHub. Work your way through the exercises until all the tests pass. Each time a new test passes, make a commit. Then when all tests pass, or when you give up, push to _your_ repo. This will be the first time you've done this, so leave plenty of time before the 7pm cut off on Thursday. This is a hard deadline, so don't miss it.

Do these tutorials to really ram this stuff into your brain.

* [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-python)
* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)

It'll go over the same stuff we've already done, but it'll be phrased in a slightly different way, that should deepen your understanding. The better you understand this really foundational stuff, the easier everything else will be.
