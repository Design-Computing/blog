# The filter

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/SkQWNwFRLOKCk/giphy.gif)

This fancy thing is making a subset of points and using them as the centre point for some spheres. It's taking advantage of the cull pattern node in Grasshopper. This actually works a lot like boolean indexing in Pandas; it takes a list of booleans and masks the other list with it. E.g. given
```
pattern = [True,  True,  False,  True]
list    = [point, point, point, point]
```

it'd give you `[point, point, null, point]`, and Grasshopper only puts spheres on points, not `null`s.

This is cool'n'all, but it's a lot of nodes to achieve a simple thing. In real life we'd probably just make a cluster to handle this, but for now, let's imagine that this is actually a really logic intensive operation that would require _loads_ of nodes, and can be achieved in just a few lines of python. (You'd be surprised how often this kind of thing happens once you start looking.)

# Getting Python in Rhino

Get the python plugin [from here](http://www.food4rhino.com/app/ghpython) and install it. That's it. Now you can use it by putting a python node onto the canvas from the _math_ panel.

# Simple Python Filter

If we plug some stuff into our node nothing will happen, but it'll give us something to work with.

To get into the editor, double click the python node:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/17/editor.png)

That gives us this slightly sad editor. (After the luxury of atom.) There's nothing in here to give us a clue what to do, it's scary!

Fear not, there are some magic variables already in scope. By default that's `x`, `y` and `a`. All of these are terrible variable names, but will change them in a minute.

Everything from now on will be in the editor unless I say otherwise. When I write:
```
print y
```
then you type it into the editor and press the **test** button. It should print a number in the grey box at the bottom. It's python 2.7 so no brackets on the print. It's actually IronPython, but we'll sweep that under the carpet for now.

We can also `print x` and we'll get something that looks like this `e194b904-86a1-48ed-ad8e-75c6e8b8b364`. This is a GUID (Globally Unique IDentifier) which is cool, but a pain to work with. If we jump out of the editor and right click on `x` then we get this menu:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/17/type_hint.png)

We want to give the input a type hint so we don't need to look after the GUID ourselves. As it's getting points, let's pick `Point3d`. Now if we look in the editor it prints `0.0553423445929505,8.63313403382578,1.51597924042306` which is the x,y,z values of the point.

:blowfish: What? There's a hundred points. Why is is only showing one? This is some grasshopper magic. It's taking each one and running the python script for each element. We can use this to make our life easier. We can make the filter like this:

```
if x.X > y:
    a = x
```
So if we plug our spheres into the `a` output it works exactly like our cull-based filter. This is nice, super terse, but single letter variables are :poop:.

If we right click on the inputs and rename them then we need to do the same in the code, but doesn't this look nicer:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/17/better_names.png)

and the code looks like this:
```
if points_to_filter.X > x_cutoff:
    filtered_points = points_to_filter
```
Which is much more readable.
