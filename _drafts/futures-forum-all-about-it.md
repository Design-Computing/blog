The Futures Forum was a 2 day conference to talk about ideas and the future.
It had a 6 month lead up program. I designed and drove the program of the event and the lead-up.

I realised that I've never actually done any kind of overall write up of it, so here one is.

# The point <small>(or why have this thing at all?)</small>

BVN has retreats every so often where everyone gets together and reinforces the _one studio_ ethos. We were overdue for one of these. James asked me to come up with a plan that made it do more than just get people to mingle. We decided that if we were going to do something like this then it had to do more than just be a knees up.

In a big architecture firm it's easy to be consumed by project work. It's very difficult to take the time to look around at all the things that are happening in the world. Synthesising all the new technology, social and political trends, and the like isn't everybody's idea of a fun night in.

This event was to be a way to get everyone to think about the future of practice. It had to change the culture of the whole studio from being a 20<sup>th</sup> century practice into a 21<sup>st</sup> century one.

# What happened?

Two days of mind expanding talks on a tropical island, preceded by a six month program of events to get people into the right frame of mind.

## In the lead-up

I had a hunch that an event as exciting as we wanted to run would have been a complete disaster if people had turned up cold. I wanted people to come into it with a lot of momentum; saying _yes_ and asking _why_ and _how_ rather than thinking that it's all too hard.

The events before the main event each did a job, and contributed to the overall momentum.

There was:

* An Iconathon
* An _Architectural Office of the Future_ essay collection
* A twitter campaign to find [#architecture #bigquestions](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23architecture%20AND%20%23bigquestions%20since%3A2014-06-01%20until%3A2015-05-30&src=typd)
* I'm ----: Ask me anything
* Lean canvas workshops
* _Design a design business_ which ended with Pecha Kucha presentations on the beach by a bonfire.
* A few informal sessions when everyone just got together to discuss things.

Here's a better explanation of each of these bits.

### Iconathon

We started the whole process off my announcing the idea of the Futures Forum to the whole studio, we had people in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Bangkok and Canberra all linked by video conference.

[Iconathon](https://iconathon.org/)s are an idea run by the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) as a way to get groups people to come up with icon sets for civic reasons. They have a really good pack of materials that make running one simple.

Here's [the Iconathon photos](https://goo.gl/photos/sMGMofMej47M2Rua7)[^icongallery][^iphotos].

I went against one of their pieces of advice. They strongly advise that you get a fixed set of nouns, but I wanted people to converge on the important nouns of architecture. If I were to do it again I would have pre-chosen the words as a lot of the words that people were trying to illustrate weren't nouns. It made for a really interesting insight into what people value in the profession, but it did make for some tricky subjects to draw.

Six icons finally made the cut for being illustrated[^ill].

### Architectural Office of the Future (AOOTF)

This was a collection of essays about the future of how architecture would be practised. The brief is in this footnote[^sBrief].

It was the first thing we did that was challenging. It didn't need everyone to be involved, but it had a great response. We had 23 essays that made it into the book in the end and a few more that were quite well formed ideas but that didn't get written up by the deadline. There was a pretty good spread of word counts and they were all well written, not just dashed off at the last minute. I was very impressed.

<iframe style="height: 380px;" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uV16hLKWbZhy6zvb4-TfSoJmkvhy9JK6SHYlIg3mHRE/pubchart?oid=924029215&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>

The resulting essays were published in a book that everyone in the studio got as a valentine's present. (There was also a little chocolate heart.) Afterwards we moved as many of the essays as we could to [a Medium publication](https://medium.com/architectural-office-of-the-future), but Medium has a pretty nice password feature that makes it a bit tricky to upload _for_ people. Ultimately we didn't get too many uploaded.

The book meant that people could take the essays home, read them on the bus, that kind of thing. This meant that we got a much better readership than if they were just posted on Tropos, the internal blog.

The essays were printed, and posted on the blog without names. The intention there was to make the responses to the essays based solely on the ideas contained, not on the author's reputation. We also managed to get the internal blog visible to the outside world so that people could read and comment at their leisure[^outside].

### #architecture #bigquestions

<figure class="half-width right">
>In 1900 David Hilbert posed a series of 23 problems to the mathematical community.

>These 23 questions have given the world of mathematics something to focus on for over a century. Some of the questions are still to be solved. Solving one pretty much guarantees that person a Field’s medal (Equivalent to a Nobel or a Pritzker prize). Architecture doesn’t have a set of key questions. This is a search to find some. A search to find if it’s even possible!

This served two jobs: the obvious one of finding out what they questions really were, and the stealth reason of getting people to engage with Twitter. It wasn't specifically Twitter that mattered but engaging in a wider discourse. That discussions mediated by technology could be meaningful and not just 'teenage drivel'.

[The results](https://notionparallax.co.uk/2015/architecture-bigquestions) were impressive. We were trending in Australia for a little while. We had some good engagement from people outside the studio as well as from within.

### I'm ----: Ask me anything (AMA)

Based on the [Reddit AMAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/) we did 21 sessions where someone would sit for a known time and answer anyone's questions.

These had quite good engagement, with about 10% of people asking questions. The answers were all very good too. Generally, people asked direct questions and got direct answers. Some of these things had probably been buring away for a long time and there hadn't been an opportunity to ask. This provided an opportunity, and also made everyone more aware of the diversity of people they work with.

### Lean canvas workshops

<figure class="half-width right">

I'm not sure about anyone else, but I find it much easier to edit someone else's work than write my own. I'll often get caught up in the details and struggle to get started. This workshop game people joke businesses, generated with [it's this for that](http://itsthisforthat.com/). (Go there, it's fun!)

There were several rounds of short pitches where each person pitched _Wikipedia for hunters_ and _Pandora for cheap vodka_ to each other. Once everyone was well warmed up they started on the canvasses.


The rigour imposed by the canvas turned several of the ludicrous inputs into some quite feasible businesses[^porc].

[^porc]: I've seen a couple pitched, since, as actual real businesses! We still had our fair share of assassinations-for-diamonds proposals, but at least they were well thought through!

This was a warm up for the next thing, the Design a design business challenge.

[^iphotos]: I can't for the life of me work out how to embed a slideshow from Google photos.

[^icongallery]: Most of these photos are taken by [Willis Lim](https://willislim.co/), at least the good ones anyway!

[^outside]: This was actually a pretty big deal. It took a heroic effort on a lot of peoples' part!

[^sBrief]: This is the post that introduced the essay collection:

    **Speculate**

    Posted on December 15, 2014 by Ben Doherty


    Have you ever thought about what you’ll be doing in 15 years time? I bet you have!


    Tl;dr: ‘Essay’ contest to find out what you think, culminating in a panel discussion and a publication.

    The Futures Forum[^s1] does a few jobs, one of them is to raise the profile of idea-having and idea-discussing. One of the things that we’re going to do is see if we’re able (we as in everyone[^s2]) to think critically or if that skill has been totally beaten out of us in service of a harmonious life and the meeting of deadlines[^s3].

    This post is a call for you to write a little piece—call it an essay if you like—about what you think the architectural office of the future is going to be like.

    I’ve picked 2030 as a future date to target. 15 years ago we were partying like 1999 (because it was 1999), I had had a Hotmail account for about 2 years, I was a bit of a whiz at ACAD 12, but I still wouldn’t get a mobile phone for another 18 months. Quite a lot has changed in that period but a lot has stayed the same. What will change in the next 15 years?

    The essay will be a description of what this future practice is like. I don’t want to prejudice you too much by using the word practice, maybe in 15 years time the idea of practising architecture will seem quaint and ridiculous.

    Once I have a load of these ideas they’ll go up on Tropos but completely anonymously. The idea of this is that without the weight of reputation behind it, the essay must stand entirely on its content. I’m hoping that this will also mean that people will be a bit more thoughtful in their comments[^s4].

    They will be released over a couple of weeks at the beginning of February, so it gives you plenty of time to mull it over.

    Getting everyone to comment on anonymous essays means that we need to not leak the content of them or their authorship before we do a grand unveiling at the end. [^s5] In other words, if you write one of these, keep it to yourself for a while!

    The format is entirely up to you so you can do it as a manga strip, a play, a regular essay or whatever you want.

[^s1]: I’ve been reading about configuration spaces recently and I’m more torn than ever about whether future ought to be plural in this context.
[^s2]: where ‘everyone’ means everyone who works here, everyone who makes a contribution to our continued existence, not just those with an architectural education – I think that that kind of apartheid thinking is reprehensible, but if you disagree I’d love to hear why in your essay!
[^s3]: To stave off accusations of pessimism: I believe the former, this is more of a case of disproving the null hypothesis. Also, if I really believed that we weren’t capable I wouldn’t be involved in this endeavour at any level.
[^s4]: Before you think to yourself “I would never let the identity of the author influence my opinion of their ideas”, countless studies have shown that you won’t be able to prevent that from happening. They’ve also shown that you would have said that too!
[^s5]: Although if you’d like to remain anonymous perpetually then that’s fine too! You get to control the release of your identity.
